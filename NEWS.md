## Version 1.0.3

Fixed a bug in calc_metrics() that would hit an error if R3 wasn't included in the history table (i.e., fewer than 5 years for a permission).

## Version 1.0.2

Small template code tweaks & more flexible update_dashboard().

## Version 1.0.1

This includes some small tweaks and improved documentation. An update_dashboard() function was also added.

## Version 1.0

This is intended to be a stable production version; expecting it to have a more or less finalized user-facing interface. Basically, the template code is complete, and there won't be breaking changes to the functions in the template code (unless something needs to be fixed.)
