## TODO

### Today

- populate workflow functions
- test with OR

### Later

- add templating functions
- add function documentation
- probably make a fill_segs() function to ensure tableau gets res/nonres, etc.
    + filling with zeroes for any missing categories (in res, sex, agecat)
    + probably won't happen for sex, agecat, but probably worth generalizing
- need to adjust nat/reg dashboard to include resident breakouts (for part. rate)
