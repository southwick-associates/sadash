## Version 0.2

- run on VA, MO, etc.

## Version 0.3

- probably write some tests
- maybe improve function documentation (e.g., with examples)
- maybe make a fill_segs() function to ensure tableau gets res/nonres, etc.
    + filling with zeroes for any missing categories (in res, sex, agecat)
    + probably won't happen for sex, agecat, but might be worth generalizing
